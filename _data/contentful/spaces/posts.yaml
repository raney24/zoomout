  title: Integration
  content: "This past Labor Day I was at the beach with my now-wife (then-fiance)
    and 4 other married couples. The crowd was larger than normal and frustrations
    were showing within our group of 10 amateur surfers. Catching a wave is hard enough
    for me, but riding one and dodging people is nearly impossible. This became frustrating
    as the day went on, and it was difficult to hold back a yelling match with a random
    stranger wading into my line. \n\nAs I was coming in from the day, I saw a younger
    group of strangers around our umbrella, and some of the ladies were beautiful
    and showing off more skin than I had asked for. At that moment, I had a choice
    to turn my eyes away and act like they didn’t exist or to indulge in the view
    I had. With my stress high and being on vacation, I chose to indulge. \n\nIf you
    don’t know my story, I have struggled with sexual integrity for the larger part
    of my life (link to “my story” post). I was losing this battle until I confessed
    to my peers, family and fiance, sought help with a counselor, and joined support
    groups. This was a battle I faced every day. Even though by this point in my journey,
    the battle had gotten easier, this temptation on the beach was hard to ignore.\n\nAll
    of the books I read had told me to look away and train my eyes not to notice or
    lust at beauty, or to repress, which is the inhibition of seeing beauty. Repression
    operates under the assumption that we can cut these visuals out of our life forever
    which isn’t realistic.  However, my counselor, Patrick Holley, introduced me to
    a concept to combat lusting I had never heard of: Integration. It is not indulging
    in the beauty we see in people, nor is it the idea of ignoring the beauty that
    God has given us. \n\nPatrick explains this phenomenally, “With indulgence, we
    are treating the object as an end in itself, which is idolatry… Repression is
    the deliberate suffocation of a desire which is intended to awaken us to God…
    ” \n\nIntegration, on the other hand, is the practice of receiving, giving, and
    letting go. “These three correlate with the three theological virtues of faith,
    hope and love,” Patrick states.\n\nIf we can agree that everyone is a child of
    God and that beautiful lady at the grocery store is a sister in Christ, then how
    can we turn our eyes away and ignore her? Instead, we can receive her beauty as
    a temporary gift from God. By no means am I saying to undress her in your mind,
    but if you can channel the beauty that she has and accept it as a gift from God,
    you will no longer be feeding your sexual desire.\n\nIntegration can be applied
    to anything. My wife has struggled with anxiety. She's been able to apply the
    same principles of receiving, giving and then letting go to anxious thoughts and
    feelings.\n\nThat night after our surfing session, Kayla, my wife, said to me,
    “Knowing the pain you go through with tempting visuals like those girls, it makes
    me want to hate them for wearing swimsuits like that.” I appreciate her passion
    and desire for my well-being, but she was quickly reminded that they are people
    and children of Christ, and that hating them was not the answer. Some unknown
    circumstances have made them who they are and made them decide to wear what they
    wore. We are just called to receive them with God’s intentions, give love to them
    like Jesus, and let go of any sexual desires we may have towards them. \n\n“Your
    eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy,
    your whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is unhealthy, your whole
    body is filled with darkness, how deep that darkness is!” Matthew 6:22-23 NLT\n\nTo
